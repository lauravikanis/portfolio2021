          Apart from working a lot on my computer, one of my main interests is
          music. I enjoy going to concerts and looking for new artists, tracks,
          and genres. Check out my Playlists on Spotify. Apart from music I also
          enjoy other aspects of arts and cultur such as visual and performing
          arts. I have an active Instagram account on which i share my love of
          taking puristic, minimalistic and symmetric pictures.
