              Hi there! Nice to meet you. <br />
              I am Laura, a Developer from Germany. <br />I worked as a graphic
              designer for 8 years but in the end, I decided to switch careers.
              I started my Developer career in summer 2020. In autumn 2020 I
              attended a 3minth Bootcamp3month Bootcamp at neue Fische which I
              successfully graduated in January 2021. The most important thing I
              learned during this intense phase of my life was to never give up
              on my dreams and never be too shy to ask questions. There is
              always a solution to problems. I now work fulltime at a
              techcompany and love to discover new technologies and learn about
              them.
            </p>
            <Zickzackpath className={classes.divider} />
            <p>
              Apart from working a lot on my computer, one of my main interests
              is music. I enjoy going to concerts and looking for new artists,
              tracks, and genres. Apart from music I also enjoy other aspects of
              arts and cultur such as visual and performing arts. I have an
              active Instagram account on which i share my love of puristic,
              minimalistic and symmetric pictures (nearly) all taken by myself.
              Here you can find a little Sneak Peak:

                about the most important music-locations in and around Cologne
                based on your favorite genre. There is a search function for
                specific locations and you also have the possibility to save
                your locations to favourites. The frontend is React-based and
                the backend works with Node.js and a MongoDB database. In the
                future I plan to add more data records to the database and thus
                extend the user experience.`}
